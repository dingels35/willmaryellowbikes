Yellow Bike is a free bike sharing program in Willmar, MN: http://www.willmar.k12.mn.us/domain/780

This project was started a Willmar's first hackathon in September 2015.  At the time the program did not have a way to track their bikes.  The initial goal of the project was to allow public users of the bikes to report when bikes are broken or abandoned.
